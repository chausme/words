## Why?

I face unfamiliar words when watch videos, read texts or listen to music. So I've decided to learn something new every day - a single word or a few, it doesn't take much time and is a fun way to kick off morning together with a cup of espresso.

## How?

General idea is to add words with their explanation, make visible at [words.mx](https://words.mx) and then evolve functionality based on my availability, also learning some cool JavaScript along the way. One of the great parts - it's useful even in a simple state and must be absolutely awesome later.

## Usage

[words.mx](https://words.mx)

That's possible to run locally with included data or add your own words. To run locally:

-   `npm run dev` - start dev server at `http://localhost:1234`
-   `npm run build` - create production build at `./dist`
-   `npm run preview` - start production preview at `http://localhost:4173`
