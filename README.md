# Words

â˜• English words every day

![Jest Tests workflow](https://github.com/chausme/words/actions/workflows/jest-tests.yml/badge.svg)

## Why?

I face unfamiliar words when watch videos, read texts or listen to music. So I've decided to learn something new every day - a single word or a few, it doesn't take much time and is a fun way to kick off morning together with a cup of espresso.

## How?

General idea is to add words with their explanation, make visible at [words.mx](https://words.mx) and then evolve functionality based on my availability, also learning some cool JavaScript along the way. One of the great parts - it's useful even in a simple state and must be absolutely awesome later.
